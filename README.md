This project aims in developing a web based application in which the faculty enters/updates the information regarding research. Earlier for inserting the Research Information used to be the traditional way of manually entering the data or through office automation which was very difficult in storing huge amount of data. The issues related to this work, people used to submit this research progress information through manually or through word documents, word pads, excel sheets and in which information is not in consolidated form. Our project aims in overcoming the above problem and to develop a web application which is user friendly, simple, fast, and costâ€“effective in allowing the users to be interactively engaged in time management related process.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Faculty pursuing Ph.D will login to our web application.
Enters all the information  related to his Ph.D work .
User  has the access to view his individual data and can download his report in PDF format.
User is  also having  the access to view the report of all other users at one place and can also download their report in PDF format.
User can only view the data of others but does not have the access to change the details of other users i.e., there is no misuse of data.
It is easy to access ,fast and simple to use.
It allows users to interactively engaged in time management related process.

SOFTWARE : LARAVEL FRAMEWORK USING MVC

 MVC
	A Model is a representation of a real-life instance or object in our code base. The View represents the interface through which the user interacts with our application. When a user takes an action, the Controller handles the action and updates the Model if necessary.
Laravel is a PHP-based web framework that is largely based on the MVC architecture. Laravel was created to make it easier for developers to get started on PHP projects. With Laravel, you think less about the setup, architecture, and dependencies of a project and go straight into the meat of the project.


LANGUAGE : PHP
PHP recursive acronym for PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor):  HyperText means, text containing all sorts of web markups, PreProcessor means all of the HyperText is processed first and then the result is sent as pure HTML to the web browser. A client cannot see the PHP source code because it is preprocessed and interpreted.
PHP is Server-side scripting language: Server-side scripting means that the PHP code is processed on the web server rather than the client machine.
PHP supports many databases (MySQL and PHP combination is widely used).
PHP is an open source scripting language


DATABASE : MY SQL 
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is the most popular database system used with PHP. MySQL is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation. The data in a MySQL database are stored in tables which consists of columns and rows
WEB TECHNOLOGIES : HTML, JAVA SCRIPT, CSS
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are three district coding languages that together are used to build Website and Web Applications
HTML
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser
CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
JAVASCRIPT     
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
JavaScript (or jQuery, a library built with JavaScript) can help you really kick it up a notch. With JavaScript, you can add, fancy effects and behavior to your website. Like adding a popup, slide shows, scroll effects, animation, form submission or Ajax page loads to name a few.
HTML and CSS are NOT programming languages, they are structure-based markup languages, there is not much logic involved with HTML or CSS. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language.
